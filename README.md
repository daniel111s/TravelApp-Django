## Description:
TravelApp is a travel planning application.
The idea to make such a project came from the fact that traveling is my passion. I wanted to create an application that keeps 
all the most important information about my travels in one place. I plan to develop the app further by adding more advanced functionality, using more advanced technologies.

Each recorded trip is one card. The travel card contains basic information such as:
- A photo of the city in question, allowing quick identification of the place
- Name of the city and country
- Date range of the trip
- Type of transportation
- Information on how many days are left until the planned start of the trip
- A brief description
There are also three buttons at the bottom of each card:
- Delete - allowing you to delete a trip
- Edit - to edit a trip
- Details - clicking on which redirects you to a page with detailed information about the trip.


After pressing the "Details" button:
