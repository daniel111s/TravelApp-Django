## Description:
TravelApp is a travel planning application.
The idea to make such a project came from the fact that traveling is my passion. I wanted to create an application that keeps 
all the most important information about my travels in one place. I plan to develop the app further by adding more advanced functionality, using more advanced technologies.

Home page, login, create a new account:

After pressing the "Sign in" button, the user is asked to log in:

After logging in, the "My Travels" page is displayed, which shows the trips the user has entered into the system:

Each recorded trip is one card. The travel card contains basic information such as:
- A photo of the city in question, allowing quick identification of the place
- Name of the city and country
- Date range of the trip
- Type of transportation
- Information on how many days are left until the planned start of the trip
- A brief description
There are also three buttons at the bottom of each card:
- Delete - allowing you to delete a trip
- Edit - to edit a trip
- Details - clicking on which redirects you to a page with detailed information about the trip.


After pressing the "Details" button:

Several cards have appeared:
- Gallery of photos - Presents a collection of photos, showing the beautiful side of a particular city.
- Places to visit - Presents a list of tourist places, worth visiting in a given city.
- Recommended hotels - Presents a list of the most popular hotels in a given city.
- Recommended restaurants - lists the most popular restaurants in a given city.
- To Do List - allows you to create a list of tasks to do


Weather Information:

Weather forecast in a particular location for the days covered by the trip. Note that for distant dates the weather forecast may not be effective. It works best as a short-term one. It is made in the form of a bootstrap "carousel", that is, every few seconds the weather illustration for a given day moves and the forecast for the next day takes its place. No need to manually scroll through the days.


City map:

A map of the city in question is also presented. It can be zoomed in, zoomed out and moved around. When you click on "directions" or "view larger map", you are redirected to Google Maps, where you have more freedom to use the maps, thus getting more accurate information.



Pressing "Gallery of photos":

Pressing "Places to visit":

Famous tourist places in Rome are displayed along with their address. If the user finds that he wants more information like opening hours, ticket prices, etc. He or she can press the "Go to Google Maps" button, which will redirect him or her to the relevant page of the place on Google. 


An example of how "Go to Google Maps" works for the Roman Forum:

An analogous action to "Places to visit."


An example of a Google page redirect for the Hiberia Rome hotel:

Analogiczne działanie, jak w przypadku „Places to visit”.


Pressing „To Do List”:

<img width="454" alt="image" src="https://github.com/daniel111s/PJF-Project-Siara/assets/126720512/a6019433-fcdf-490d-a397-0259ad58625f">
Tasks to do, previously entered by the user, are displayed.
The user can delete, edit or add a new task.
This site definitely needs front-end improvement :)
